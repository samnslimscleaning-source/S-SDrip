🧵 S$S Drip — Urban Threads with a Story
Welcome to S$S Drip, where streetwear meets soul. Founded in Oklahoma City, S$S Drip is more than a brand—it's a movement. Every piece is designed to reflect hustle, heritage, and heat. We blend graffiti-inspired visuals, bold color palettes, and unapologetic energy to create merch that speaks louder than words.

🛠 Built By Samantha
Samantha is the founder, creative director, and heartbeat of S$S Drip. She designs every logo, curates every color, and crafts every caption with intention. Her empire includes Sam & Slims Cleaning LLC, S&S Trending, S&S Handy Solutions, and now S$S Drip—each with its own flavor, all rooted in originality.
